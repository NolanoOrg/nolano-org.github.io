Generating high-quality language is crucial for modern AI systems, and GPT-3 is one of the most robust language models available today. However, it requires significant computational resources, making it inaccessible for many researchers and developers. Fortunately, recent LLM inference advancements have led to the development of smaller models along with Nolano's optimization, that can achieve GPT-3 level performance with lower computational power. This is particularly exciting for Mac Book users as they can now conduct LLM inference at 20 tokens per second, making it a more accessible tool for various applications.

Nolano's On-Edge Support is a new service that allows you to leverage the power of GPT-3 without the need for a powerful GPU. With On-Edge Support, you can now generate high-quality language on your Mac Book, making it a more accessible tool for various applications.
