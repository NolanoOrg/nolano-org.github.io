I am a Masters in Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions to real-world problems. My inclination is towards data in the text, image and audio modalities and I am very interested in making large language models feasible for deployment.

My experiences in Machine Learning stems from my research internships at Google, IBM, ETH Zurich, University of Oregon and IIT Kharagpur. I am grateful to all my co-authors and mentors to help me excel in these internships.

As an undergraudate, I developed various Open Source software - including web applications and NLP/ML packages in Julia programming languages. I presented these at the JuliaCon 2020 conference and in the Journal of Open Source software. I have also won numerous hackathons and competitions in Machine Learning and AI-related areas - Cogito's 2021, EMNLP 2020' W-NUT Covid challenge, AllenNLP 2021 hackathon, and Opensoft 2018.

I did my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (2017-21). My Bachelor Thesis was under the guidance of Prof. Niloy Ganguly on Twitter Stance Detection. It was acclaimed among the Best Bachelor's Thesis and a portion of it was published to NAACL'21.
