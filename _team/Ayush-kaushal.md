I am a Masters in Computer Science student from the University of Texas at Austin with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With extensive research internships at Google, IBM, ETH Zurich, University of Oregon, and IIT Kharagpur, I have developed expertise in data in the text, image, and audio modalities, and are particularly interested in making large language models feasible for deployment.  I did my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (2017-21).
