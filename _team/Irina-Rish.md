Irina Rish is a Full Professor in the Computer Science and Operations Research Department at the Université de Montréal (UdeM), and a core member of Mila - Quebec AI Institute. She holds a Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Autonomous AI and a Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Canada AI Chair. Dr Rish received her MSc and PhD in AI from University of California, Irvine and MSc in Applied Mathematics from Moscow Gubkin Institute. 

Over the past decades,  her research has spanned multiple areas of AI, from automated reasoning, constraint networks and  probabilistic inference in graphical models  to more recent focus on machine learning, sparse modeling,  neural data analysis and neuroscience-inspired AI,  which included neuroscience-inspired learning algorithms  (beyond backpropagation), biologically plausible reinforcement learning,  as well as dynamical systems approaches to brain imaging analysis  dialog generation for (semi)automated therapy.

Irina's current research interests include continual learning, out-of-distribution generalization and robustness of deep neural networks, large-scale models and scaling laws of deep network properties with increasing amounts of data, parameters and compute.  She considers these research areas essential for achieving the holy grail of AI field, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
