I am a graduate student in computer science at MILA and University of Montreal, supervised by Prof. Dhanya Sridhar. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Causal Inference, scaling laws, explainability, and Transformer based Language models. I aim to develop technologies and agents that can reason about their environment and communicate via natural language. I am also curious about economics, psychology, and philosophy.
