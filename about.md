Welcome to Nolano,
We aim to democratize AI by running chatbots and co-pilots on your personal devices. We focus on two main areas:

1. Machine Learning Research: To optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal hardware using techniques like better training, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.

2. Easy-to-use API: To ensure rapid AI inference and ease model integration across various applications.

Additionally, we're offering Compression as a Service, reducing the size of your models for efficiency. Our open-source libraries aim to make AI more accessible and usable.
