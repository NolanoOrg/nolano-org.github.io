Welcome to Nolano, <br>

Our primary focus is on drastically reducing the cost of running large-scale generative AI models by <br> 
(1) developing and deploying state-of-art model compression techniques and  <br>
(2) enabling fast inference in such compressed models. <br>    
We aim to maximally reduce the size and inference cost of modern generative AI models, while maintaining their capabilities. Our models are designed to be easily deployable across a variety of platforms and applications, from mobile devices to cloud-based servers, providing a versatile solution for businesses and individuals alike. <br>

Additionally, we're offering Compression as a Service, reducing the size of your models for efficiency on cloud, phone and laptops. Our open-source libraries aim to make AI more accessible and usable.
