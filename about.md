Welcome to Nolano,
The primary objective of the Nolano community is to democratize access to Large Language Models (LLMs) for creators, developers, and researchers. To achieve this goal, the community focuses on two main areas: 

1. Machine Learning Research & Exploration 
2. Easy-to-use API for fast AI inference.

Nolano helps individuals optimize the CPU inference of LLMs by developing techniques like better-trained models, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Furthermore, Nolano aims to remove entry barriers by creating open-source libraries and building hubs such as Hugging Face, which facilitate model integration in various applications.
